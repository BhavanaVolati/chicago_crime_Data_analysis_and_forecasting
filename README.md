# Chicago_Crime_Data_Analysis_and_Forecasting
This project aims to forecast crime rates in Chicago using the Prophet model, a powerful forecasting tool developed by Facebook. The model is designed to handle time series data, making it ideal for predicting trends in crime rates over time.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and forecasting crime incidents in Chicago using historical crime data. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in crime over time, and the forecasting model predicts future crime occurrences to help authorities allocate resources more effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on crime incidents in Chicago, including the type of crime, location, date, time, and other relevant features. The data is sourced from Chicago's open data portal.

## Project Structure
Ads_crime_forecast.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow of data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, model building, and forecasting.
## Key Steps

### Data Preprocessing:
* Loading the dataset.
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Feature engineering: Extracting useful features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Visualizing crime trends over time.
* Analyzing the distribution of different types of crimes.

### Modeling:

* Building time series forecasting models to predict future crime occurrences.

### Forecasting:

Generating forecasts for future crime occurrences.
Visualizing the forecasted values and comparing them with actual data.

## Future Work
* Improving the model by incorporating more advanced techniques such as deep learning.
* Exploring the impact of external factors (e.g., weather, events) on crime rates.
* Deploying the model as a web application for real-time crime forecasting.
